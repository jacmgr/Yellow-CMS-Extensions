# Restrict User Access to Pages

Trying to figure out the best way to restrict access to a site to just myself.  I only have 1 user through the [yellow edit extension](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-edit).  I looked at the [restrict extension](url) and the [draft](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-draft) and the [private extension(https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-private). Each has some pros and cons, but they don't do what I intended.  For now I settled on a couple solutions.

>  UNFINISHED README..... You can see it in action at [Author's example Site](https://www.urichip.com/sites/ibrowser/)  Make sure you read to the bottom of the page to see how to login and try it out.
